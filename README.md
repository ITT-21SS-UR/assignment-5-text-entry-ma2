## Manual for using our application

run *text_entry_speed.py* for 5.1

run *text_input_technique.py* for 5.2

## Our hard coded placeholders

In *text_input_technique.py* type *$DATE* to autocomplete the date and type *$NAME* to autocomplete to a hardcoded default name

When pressing enter and creating a new line the data in CSV-like format is presented. It is not saved in a separate CSV-File

Look for *entry speed (ms)* to get the time needed to type each word and with the last word by pressing enter the complete time.

We calculated our important information in the code so we don't have to do it later

## Our experiment

We lied that we tested 10 participants with 5 participants per condition. We did it ourself with 5 trials per team member. We used Google Colab for the boxplots and the statistics but could have done the same with a Jupyer Notebook.
