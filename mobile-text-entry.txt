First of all the paper is nearly 20 years old and has been cited 754 times on Google Scholar. It provides rich information for people who need a broad overview over the research topic. A remarkable fact is that the paper already predicted several further developments and innovation in the future (e.g. typing on a keyboard as the primary option to handle text input) but had no idea that touch-based applications like every modern smartphone could be possible. They raise some important questions that can be confidently answered today (p. 153-154):The QWERTY/QWERTZ layout for keyboards has been the dominant way for typing input and will likely be in the futureGuessing what the user will type next and dynamically proposing it to the user is known and established as autocompletionThe conducted study focuses on creating text and copying text as two relevant input scenarios. They introduce speed and accuracy as metrics to measure usability of text input. To achieve better performance two aspects can be improved – minimization of movement and language prediction. Fitt’s Law and an appropriate language corpus are major aspects to design a (mobile) keyboard for text input (pp. 193).It is conspicuous that the authors did not see the possibility to integrate the keyboard into the screen which is the dominant way to go in every smartphone nowadays. With only few buttons left, mobile text input is reduced to interacting on the screen directly. It is also interesting that typing is described as the main channel for text input and it has remained the same in 2021. Speech-to-text (dictating) is present nowadays but not the common way and other novel interaction technologies like gesture-to-text are irrelevant for today’s mass market target group.Written by Marco Beetz (05/19/21)
